# iconnmon - Internet Connection Monitoring
A small package to use for monitoring your internet connection. 

## Under development
The package is currently in it's very beginning, and being developed. So far there is no monitoring functionality at all.
The only functionality are methods for pinging an ip address and receiving the result.
In the coming time, methods will be added for parsing the ping result, so it can be stored in an InFlux database.

# The idea
...is to be able to ping a number of hosts - i.e. the hop after your router and your router ip - and then add the results to InFlux. Then creating a web page which will visualize the connectivity. 
This way it should be possible to get uptime statistics for the internet connection, to pinpoint any outages.
